This year, we reached 20,268 developers in 153 different countries. While the **U.S.** dominates the survey as expected with 24% of respondents, **Germany** and **Australia** are both well-represented, with over 5% of respondents each. 

Note: one factor that could definitely help us reach broader, more international audiences in the future would be translating the survey and survey results in multiple languages. If you think you can help, please [let us know](https://github.com/StateOfJS/StateOfJS/issues/87)!

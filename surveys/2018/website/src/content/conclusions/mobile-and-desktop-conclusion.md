This category shows clearly how JavaScript expanded its "scope" far beyond the limits of the Internet browser.

React Native and Electron are the two leading solutions to build respectively mobile and desktop applications from web technologies.
Coincidentally we got similar numbers in both satisfaction rate and number of users.

Electron versatility (it can work with any UI framework even if it's often associated with React or Vue.js) may explain the highest satisfaction ratio of the category.

The future of desktop application may include [Carlo](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/carlo), a brand new “Headful Note app framework” released by Google Chrome Labs, built on top of [Puppeteer](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/carlo).

There were a lot of talks about React Native a few months ago when AirBnb published [a thorough series of article](https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering/react-native-at-airbnb-f95aa460be1c) explaining why they decided to drop React Native for their next products in favor of Native Apps.

Talking about Native Apps, it's interesting to note that they got the 3rd satisfaction rate (79%), especially if you consider that the survey targets JavaScript developers (and not Android or Swift developers).

As an alternative to React Native, for developers who want to write cross-platform applications in JavaScript but without using React patterns, we could mention [Weex](https://weex.apache.org/) that let developers use the Vue.js eco-system.

The future of cross-platform mobile frameworks may be [Flutter](https://flutter.io/) from Goggle.
Instead of building a JavaScript "bridge" like React Native does, it compiles to true native code. But the code is written in Dart language, so React Native will be still relevant to most of JavaScript developers already familiar with the React system.

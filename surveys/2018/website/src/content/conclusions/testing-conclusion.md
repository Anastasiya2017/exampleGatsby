The testing space is a bit of an oddity: while the other parts of the JavaScript ecosystem have been slowly settling down around a few dominant solutions, testing is still very fragmented: lots of different, complementary tools share the pie. Even so, developers are satisfied by their testing solution overall, with the lowest satisfaction ratio being 68%.

The survey confirms that **Mocha** is still the most used unit testing framework with over 10k users. Being around for a long time, it has the largest ecosystem and most of the Node.js developers are familiar with it.

**Jest** follows closely in terms of usage but it has a slightly higher satisfaction rate: 96% versus 82%. As a side note, 96% is the second highest satisfaction in the whole survey this year. Only ES6 got a better mark!

This shows that developers really appreciate the efforts made by Facebook to provide a a full-featured testing framework that can be used to test both front-end (it was intended to test React components, in the beginning) and back-end code, without requiring configuration.

**Storybook** got the second highest satisfaction rate of the category. It's not a testing framework per se, but a solution to let developers test their components in isolation. It was first intended for React developers but it now supports **Vue.js**, **Angular**, and more; and comes with a lot of handy plugins to customize its functionalities.

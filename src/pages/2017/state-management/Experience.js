                    State Management is an emerging category in JavaScript, and not necessarily one
                    every developer needs a tool for at the moment.

                    Redux is clearly the most popular of the Flux implementations, an architecture
                    championed by Facebook as a system for managing state globally in React or other
                    frontend libraries.

                    Here, we are talking about integrated solutions to build web applications from
                    the back-end side (including the database and the web server) to the front-end
                    layer, using only one language (JavaScript).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Let's face facts: unlike other categories like front-end frameworks, there are
                    very few true contenders in this category apart from Express.

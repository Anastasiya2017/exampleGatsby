                    When you talk about “JavaScript”, you're not just talking about a single
                    language: it's actually more like a family of closely related cousins.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What started with CoffeeScript back in 2009 has become an explosion of choice
                    over the past couple years: ES6, TypeScript, Elm… they all have their strengths,
                    and they're all growing more and more popular.
                </p>

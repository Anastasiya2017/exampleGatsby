### Interest

..Thing

The most interesting framework of the lot was Mocha, with 75% of people who'd
heard of it wanting to learn it, followed shortly by Enzyme at 72%.

At this point a little self-promotion is in order: my tutorial [React Unit
Testing with Mocha and Enzyme](https://medium.com/p/77d18b6875cb) is a great way
to kill those two birds with one stone.

Compared to the other sections of the poll, people generally seemed interested
in picking up different testing frameworks, with the "want to learn" percentage
ranging between 45-75% across the board, as opposed to other sections where
people have generally heard of other frameworks, but are not particularly
interested in learning them, which percentages ranging from 10-40%.

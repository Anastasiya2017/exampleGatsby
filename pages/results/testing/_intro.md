### Mocha, Jasmine, Whatever

Like the rest of Javascript world, the testing landscape is highly competitive
one, with rapid release cycles, feature and performance comparisons, and
constant one-upsmanship between the frameworks. Unlike the rest of the
Javascript world, most of us have never heard of most of the testing packages
here.

Only a small minority of us had heard of Enzyme, Jest, and Ava. And a slight
majority had heard of Cucumber, but were not interested in learning it, or had
used it and wouldn't use it again. Harsh.

Mocha and Jasmine dominated the poll, with Mocha edging out Jasmine in awareness,
interest, and satisfaction.

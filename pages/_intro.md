Depending on who you ask, right now JavaScript is either turning into a modern, reliable language, or a bloated, [overly complex dependency hell](https://twitter.com/thomasfuchs/status/708675139253174273). Or maybe both?

What's more, there's just *so many* options: Do you use React or Angular 2? Do you really need Webpack? And what's this month's recommended way of dealing with CSS?

Like you, I spent far too many hours reading about all this, and at the end I *still* wasn't sure. So I decided to create this survey to see what everybody else thinks:

#### The survey is now over. Thanks to everybody who took it, and stay tuned for the results!

The survey shouldn't take you more than 10-15 minutes. Good luck!

_**Update**: you can already check out some [preliminary results here](https://medium.com/@sachagreif/the-state-of-javascript-front-end-frameworks-1a2d8a61510)._

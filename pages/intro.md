Depending on who you ask, right now JavaScript is either turning into a modern, reliable language, or a bloated, [overly complex dependency hell](https://twitter.com/thomasfuchs/status/708675139253174273). Or maybe both?

What's more, there's just *so many* options: Do you use React or Angular 2? Do you really need Webpack? And what's this month's recommended way of dealing with CSS?

Like you, I spent far too many hours reading about all this, and at the end I *still* wasn't sure. So I decided to create this survey to see what everybody else thinks:

<div class="take-survey">
  <a class="take-survey-button" href="https://stateofjs.typeform.com/to/aYkckG">Take the Survey</a>
</div>

The survey shouldn't take you more than 10-15 minutes. Good luck!

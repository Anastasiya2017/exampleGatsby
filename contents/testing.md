### Mocha, Jasmine, Whatever

Like the rest of Javascript world, the testing landscape is highly competitive
one, with rapid release cycles, feature and performance comparisons, and
constant one-upsmanship between the frameworks. Unlike the rest of the
Javascript world, most of us have never heard of most of the testing packages
here.

Only a small minority of us had heard of Enzyme, Jest, and Ava. And a slight
majority had heard of Cucumber, but were not interested in learning it, or had
used it and wouldn't use it again. Harsh.

Mocha and Jasmine dominated the poll, with Mocha edging out Jasmine in awareness,
interest, and satisfaction.

### Interest

The most interesting framework of the lot was Mocha, with 75% of people who'd
heard of it wanting to learn it, followed shortly by Enzyme at 72%.

At this point a little self-promotion is in order: my tutorial [React Unit
Testing with Mocha and Enzyme](https://medium.com/p/77d18b6875cb) is a great way
to kill those two birds with one stone.

Compared to the other sections of the poll, people generally seemed interested
in picking up different testing frameworks, with the "want to learn" percentage
ranging between 45-75% across the board, as opposed to other sections where
people have generally heard of other frameworks, but are not particularly
interested in learning them, which percentages ranging from 10-40%.

### Can't Get No...

I wrote a cucumber spec for this section of the poll:

```
Given you are testing JS,
When you use Cucumber,
Then you never want to use it again.
```

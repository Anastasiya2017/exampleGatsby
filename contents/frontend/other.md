I wasn't very familiar with **Aurelia** before the survey but I sure am now, since it lead the "other" responses by a mile. This of course doesn't tell us how happy people are with the framework, but I think it's safe to say that if that many people wrote it in, Aurelia must be doing something right. 

Coming in second is **Meteor** and its own front-end framework, **Blaze**. Meteor is already featured in the [full-stack](/fullstack) section, which is why it wasn't included in the default options. 

The rest of the results can roughly be split in two very different categories: legacy frameworks like Knockout, jQuery, or Dojo; and newer, cutting-edge libraries like Cycle, Polymer, or Mithril. 

If nothing else, this list illustrates just how diverse the JavaScript front-end ecosystem truly is. Which makes sense: before Node came around, the front-end was the original JavaScript battleground.

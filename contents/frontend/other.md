I wasn't very familiar with **Aurelia** before the survey but I sure am now, since it lead the "other" responses by a mile. This of course doesn't tell us how happy people are with the framework, but I think it's safe to say that if that many people wrote it in, Aurelia must be doing something right. 

Coming in second is **Meteor** and its own front-end framework, **Blaze**. Meteor is already featured in the [full-stack](/fullstack) section, which is why it wasn't included in the default options. 

The rest of the results can roughly be split in two very different categories: legacy frameworks like Knockout, jQuery, or Dojo; and newer, cutting-edge libraries like Cycle, Polymer, or Mithril. 

If nothing else, this list illustrates just how diverse the JavaScript front-end ecosystem truly is. Which makes sense: before Node came around, the front-end was the original JavaScript battleground. 

Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum

### Awareness

The battle for JavaScript mindshare is often led by front-end frameworks, and this comes through in the survey results: apart form newcomer **Vue**, every option here stands at over 97% awareness. 

### Interest

While awareness is pretty much a draw, things start getting interesting when you look at interest. **Angular 2** is still brand new, so in absolute numbers it leads the pack when it comes to technologies people are interested in learning. 

But if you look at percentages, it turns out the uncontested leader is instead **React**. What's more surprising is Vue's performance, coming second by both measures. 

### Satisfaction

Looking at satisfaction might explain why: while React dominates the ranking at a 92% "would use again" rating, Vue is right on its heels at 89%. With such a high developer satisfaction rating, it's no surprise if Vue is generating more and more momentum. 

I think it's fair to say that React and Vue are in a class of their own here, with Angular 2 being somewhat of an unknown, and Angular, Ember, and Backbone trailing behind.

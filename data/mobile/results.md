The landscape for building mobile apps with JavaScript is still very young, and as expected, the **Native Apps** category still pulls in the highest awareness rating of the survey, as well as a very high satisfaction rating at 84%. 

The challenge with native platforms is a doubling of cost/effort when you want to cover more platforms. This was often a non-issue in the past, because customers and clients of mine would only care about targeting iOS thanks to its huge userbase. 

This is quickly changing though as Android now owns over 60% of the market share. This leaves a lot of developers wanting to figure out a way to deliver a quality app for both environments, with as little redundant work as possible.

JavaScript has been the path to easily build for both platforms with an easy to learn language, strong tooling, and a growing developer population. **React Native** is the obvious 800-pound gorilla in the JavaScript category here, with its super high 92% satisfaction rating and a 78% interest-to-learn rating. 

**Cordova** and **PhoneGap** (which are basically the same thing) have much lower interest ratings, and it makes you wonder if people are turned off by the performance issues you sometimes hear about. With Cordova and PhoneGap, you rely on the underlying phone browser and its JavaScript engine to do the heavy lifting, which is often slower than running native code like React Native.

The newcomer in the space is **Native Script** with 49% of respondents saying they've never heard of it. While it can be used directly, it also offers easy integration with Angular 2 for building your application.

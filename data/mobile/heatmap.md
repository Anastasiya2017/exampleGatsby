Right off the bat, we can see a strong correlation between PhoneGap and Cordova, which makes sense as they're basically the same technology. 

The other point of interest here is that React Native developers tend to have a higher correlation for things like React, Redux, and particularly using testing frameworks and tools. It is no secret that I am a fan of writing tests, but a lot of the correlation numbers seem to point to a lack of enthusiasm for testing when using other mobile building platforms.

It is also very interesting that people who mentioned native development have a higher correlation with people who mentioned React Native. I've heard from many native developers that they enjoy the process of building React Native applications, too.

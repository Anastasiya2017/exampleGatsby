We have an interesting thing occurring in this graph, another Cordova integration framework like PhoneGap is taking the top spot - **Ionic**. 

Ionic provides a UI interface, build tools, etc on top of Cordova. I think it is an interesting choice and if you are fine with browser engine JavaScript performance, Ionic can give you a lot of initial development speed to launch something.

The other point of interest in this graph is **Progressive Web Apps**. This is a relatively new concept being pioneered by Google. Progressive Web Apps (PWA for short) allows a developer to create a web app like normal, but then you attach a manifest for files needed to run the app, a service work, and a few other things to build an installable app that can be downloaded via the browser. 

This allows developers to deliver a smooth and easy installation experience right from the web app. The downside of this approach right now is a total lack of support from mobile Safari, leaving a big question mark in how to support this line of development for both Android and iOS.

  The state of JavaScript is there is too little attention to keeping things simple.
- >
  The "class" keyword is the worst thing that ever happened.
- >
  I don't think this survey is well planned.
- >
  Thank You JS! Lost my job today because of you being so unfriendly, counterintuitive, impossible to grasp in big sophisticated code base.
- >
  Really excited to see everyone's response.
- >
  This survey is ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥

  Angular 1.0 is the worst framework I've ever used in my career.
- >
  Stylus is underrated. Meteor is underrated. Redux is overrated.
- >
  I hate Angular with the passion of a thousand burning suns. 
- >
  You hate Microsoft. 
- >
  In many ways, Javascript/CSS is moving along well; I'd just wish browsers kept up.
- >
  Thanks for taking the time to put this together and sharing it with the community.

  It seems JavaScript is going in two directions, where one is functional and the other one is object-oriented programming and Java-like syntax.
- >
  Web development is an absolute nightmare. Far too much accidental complexity, needless instability of frameworks, and Node.js is just wrong.
- >
  JavaScript is almost beyond repair at this point - but nice survey!
- >
  You forgot to ask how many spaces. I say every indent should be a prime number of spaces. So the first indent is 2 spaces, then the next indent is 2+3 spaces, then 2+3+5 spacesâ€¦ and so on.

  Polymer makes Angular irrelevant.
- >
  Next time make a survey that works with Javascript disabled.
- >
  Writing JavaSript for almost 7 years. And it's a terrible programming language. 
- >
  I'm doing Elm full-time now, and I can't see myself going back to a dynamic language, let alone one without a strong type system with inference.
- >
  The future looks bright (service workers, web workers, offline-first apps, hot updates, better developer workflows such as hot-reloading)
- >
  I think JavaScript is most exciting as a compilation target. Major languages like Haskell, Ruby, Scala, and Clojure can be compiled to JS with varying degrees of maturity. 
- >
  I would be interested to hear community opinions about the number of dependencies needed for JavaScript projects.
- >
  Take a step back, and realise that when your package.json is 100+ lines just for modules, you have a serious flaw, as those modules can freely pull in more modules.
- >
  Should have asked, "Does JavaScript need a type system?". I'd strongly agree.
- >
  I think we, as a community, are picking complexity instead of simplicity because it looks cool and is pushed by the big mind-share companies like Facebook and Google.
- >
  Seriously, the survey is too damn long. Almost closed the tab when I saw how much it takes, but I had nothing to do at that moment anyway.
- >
  I don't like your survey.
- >
  That was a pleasant survey. Like a walk in a park.
- >
  "What is your opinion on Brendan Eich?" was a question I was missing. I love trolling him.
- >
  Do you believe the fate of the world depends on service workers or will we continue fine without them?
- >
  Donald Trump is dumb.
- >
  Which Pokemon is your favorite? Haunter, the answer is always Haunter. Pikachu is cool too though.
- >
  JavaScript is in many ways a stupid language. And yet this survey has me wanting to look up the things I didn't know about and learn more. It's a silly language, and yet I can't get enough of it. 
- >
  Asking about frameworks and build tools is so 2013
- >
  Wow such survey, much amaze
- >
  It's my 42nd birthday tomorrow. I'm not sure how I feel about it.
- >
  I think that the JavaScript community is being torn appart by the people that once raised it to its maximum glory.
- >
  Good you had Elm and Clojurescript in there. Especially Elm seems like it could be the right way forward for JavaScript.
- >
  I love the direction JavaScript is moving in, but the amount of setup/complexity required to be able to use these features today is prohibitive.
- >
  What about a survey on Node.js and back-end development?
- >
  JavaScript is a horrible language that sent software development back to the dark ages. It has taken over 20 years to get this unruly abomination of a language to a useful and enjoyable state. 
- >
  I enjoyed this survey, 3/5 badgers.
- >
  Technically Webstorm is an IDE, not a text editor. Who uses text editors for serious development!?
- >
  This was the most beautiful survey I've ever filled. It was a bit long, but not once did I think of dropping out halfway through.
- >
  \(  o_o)/

  The survey was way too longâ€¦ I am both impressed you made it and hate you for it ;-).
- >
  Thank you for taking the time to put something like this together. I will be very curious about how the results turn out.
- >
  Every time I write something in JavaScript I'm surprised that it works.

Congratulations for making it all the way through! I have to confess that when I first had the idea for a JavaScript survey, I never expected the project would grow that large. But as it turns out, there's quite a lot to say about the JavaScript ecosystem!

This entire enterprise grew out of my own search for clarity, and I think it's fair to say that the survey data certainly provided some answers. 

### Download the Data

Speaking of data, you can [download the raw anonymized data here](https://gumroad.com/l/hLWTB). 

The data is available on a pay-what-you-want basis, so if you think what I've done here is valuable, you can optionally support this project with a small donation.

### Winners & Losers

Some technologies turned out to be clear winners (React), some emerged as promising up-and-comers (Vue), and some proved to be on their way out (CoffeeScript).

At the same time, things get murkier when it comes to areas such as testing, state management, or the API layer. Will Redux be able to maintain its (relative) dominance? Will GraphQL fulfill its destiny and end up replacing REST? Will we *finally* find a way to test JavaScript apps we can all agree on?

### Looking to the Future

But as valuable as these lessons are, what excites me most is being able to do this survey again in the near future and see how all these trends have evolved. 

If you'd like to know when that happens, here's a handy form so you can leave me your email address:

..Newsletter conclusion

If I had to draw a single conclusion from all this though, it would be that the future looks bright for JavaScript. Sure, the churn rate is high, but on the other hand each successive generation of libraries is making huge leaps in terms of maintainability and developer experience.

So it's fine if the road is a little bumpy at times, because I'm pretty sure it goes in the right direction.

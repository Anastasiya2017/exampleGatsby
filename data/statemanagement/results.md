### Awareness

State Management is an emerging category in JavaScript, and not necessarily one every developer needs a tool for at the moment. 

[Redux](http://redux.js.org/) is clearly the most popular of the Flux implementations, an architecture championed by Facebook as a system for managing state globally in React or other frontend libraries. 87% of users had heard of Redux, which is pretty incredible given it is barely a year old and competing for mindshare with a host of other Flux implementations (as we'll see below).

On the other hand, despite being one of the most established Redux alternatives [MobX](https://mobxjs.github.io/mobx/) still has only 30% awareness. 

### Interest

Interest is pretty high in all of these tools, especially Redux (81% of people who know about it wanting to try it), which fits the narrative of increasingly complex front-end applications. Given most of these tools didn't exist two years ago, it's clearly a rapidly changing landscape.

It's especially interesting seeing the high level of interest in Redux, given that Redux creator Dan Abramov repeatedly stresses that [not every app needs it](https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/you-might-not-need-redux-be46360cf367#.hm1h7kmdk), and that users should wait until they run into problems before building an app with Redux.

### Satisfaction

Overall, Redux users are happy users with one of the highest satisfaction ratings of any library; MobX and [Relay](https://facebook.github.io/relay/) are middling in this respect and we can perhaps expect to see other competitors emerge in the months to come in this rapidly changing area.

It certainly won't be a surprise to see a big difference in this area in future surveys.

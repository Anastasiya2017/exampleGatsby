Perhaps unsurprisingly, there are a plethora of alternative state management solutions used; around half of which are competing Flux implementations. However the low absolute numbers here indicate that Redux has won the race for Flux mindshare, and most of the non Flux libraries here are associated with a specific front end framework like [Vuex](https://vuex.vuejs.org/en/index.html).

[RxJS](http://reactivex.io/rxjs/), [Elm](http://elm-lang.org/), and [CycleJS](http://cycle.js.org) are probably the ones to pick out here as interesting up-and-coming state management solutions; however their low absolute numbers makes it hard to tell much about their momentum.

44% of people who used a full-stack framework are happy with their solution (4 or 5 points on the scale). We can assume that they enjoy how quickly these frameworks let them build web applications.

34% of people who used a full-stack framework have a neutral point of view, so it seems that there is still room for improvement.

The remaining 21% who have a negative feedback may have been disappointed by things like “too much magic” (I am looking at you Meteor!) or “too many things to wire together” (something often heard about Redux).

It's important to note that Meteor used to be a unique solution of its own, apart from the rest of the NPM ecosystem with its own packaging system and its own templating engine. But things have changed since the 1.3 release, and it's now possible to build full-stack applications using React, ES6, and NPM modules without any problem.

We are still waiting for the “killer solution”, but there are so many moving parts in the JavaScript world that assembling the best elements to create a solution that covers all use-cases looks like mission impossible!

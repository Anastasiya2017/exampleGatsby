Meteor seems to play well with Apollo (a back-end solution based on GraphQL) and Cordova (a tool to build mobile applications). Strangely enough, ES6 got a low score despite the full support provided by Meteor latest releases.

The MEAN stack plays well with Angular and Angular2, and therefore Typescript. We can see also connections with Bower, Gulp and Grunt, which may bring up memories for some of us.

On the contrary, the MERN stack connects to React, Redux and Webpack. These three technologies are often called "the modern stack" to build web applicationâ€¦ but who knows if it will still be true in 2017 ?

The testing landscape is just as fragmented, with MEAN users choosing Jasmine while MERN users prefer Mocha.

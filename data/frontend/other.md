I wasn't very familiar with [Aurelia](http://aurelia.io/) before the survey but I sure am now, since it lead the "other" responses by a mile. This of course doesn't tell us how happy people are with the framework, but I think it's safe to say that if that many people wrote it in, Aurelia must be doing something right. 

Coming in second is [Meteor](http://meteor.com/) and its own front-end framework, [Blaze](http://blazejs.org/). Meteor is already featured in the [full-stack](/fullstack) section, which is why it wasn't included in the default options. 

The rest of the results can roughly be split in two very different categories: legacy frameworks like [Knockout](http://knockoutjs.com/), [jQuery](http://jquery.com/), or [Dojo](https://dojotoolkit.org/); and newer, cutting-edge libraries like [Cycle](http://cycle.js.org/), [Polymer](https://www.polymer-project.org/), or [Mithril](http://mithril.js.org/). 

If nothing else, this list illustrates just how diverse the JavaScript front-end ecosystem truly is. Which makes sense: before Node came around, the front-end was the original JavaScript battleground.

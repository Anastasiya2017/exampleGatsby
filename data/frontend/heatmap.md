Looking at the heatmap, the thing that stands out right away is how the React row just lights up compared to the other front-end frameworks. In other words, React users are more likely than average to have experimented with multiple other technologies.

This is especially true for Redux, Enzyme, and React Native. This is not really surprising since these are all made to work together, but it's still interesting to see patterns emerge.

And interestingly enough, while as expected Angular users tend to not want to use React, it turns out Angular *2* users have a much more favorable view of their main competitor!

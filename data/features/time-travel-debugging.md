With better state management tools such as Redux coming out, new coding and debugging patterns are emerging as well. 

**Time-travel debugging** takes advantage of the fact that Redux stores the successive states of your app to let you "travel" through them, simulating infinite undos and redos. 

As more developers embrace these new state management libraries, I expect this technique will become more and more popular.

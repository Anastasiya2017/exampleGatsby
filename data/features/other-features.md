Here are some of the other features frequently mentioned:

### Offline Usage

What happens to our apps when the user's Internet connection goes down? Do we know? Do we even care?

It can be tempting to dismiss this as an unsolvable edge case, but there's a growing awareness that maybe we shouldn't, as shown by the fact that offline access was by far the most frequently mentioned other feature (23 mentions). 

Any app that might conceivably be used from a smartphone should account for the possibility of disconnects, reconnects, and the offline use and data syncing issues that they entail. 

### Service Workers

Service workers (11 mentions) are instrumental in implementing the offline capabilities mentioned above. 

Even though browser support is currently still lacking, 2017 might very well be the year when service workers start seeing more widespread usage. 

### Static Type System

JavaScript may not have a static type system, but that doesn't mean you can't give it one. Angular 2's adoption of TypeScript and projects like [Flow](https://flowtype.org/) are a big indicator that strong type systems (11 mentions) are considered by many to be a welcome addition to JavaScript. 

### Accessibility

Accessibility (10 mentions) is too often one of the first casualties when new, unfamiliar technologies are introduced. After all, it can be hard to find the time to make your app accessible when you're already days behind schedule.

That's why it's great when frameworks can offer tools to help you nail accessibility right from the start.

### Isomorphic Architecture

“Isomorphic Architecture” (3 mentions) is a fancy way of saying you should be able to share code between client and server. 

The biggest challenge of building JavaScript apps is managing the client/server split, so it makes sense that you'd want to share the same language and code across both environments to minimize complexity and context switching. 

This is not always straightforward though: even though some frameworks like [Meteor](http://meteor.com) make this one of their core tenets, it's not always easy to know how to draw the line and decide what should go where.

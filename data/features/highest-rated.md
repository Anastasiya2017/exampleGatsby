So what do we get if we average out all the ratings and rank features by how useful they were deemed?

Unexpectedly, code splitting and dead code elimination lead the pack, which is surprising given that these two features are not yet very widespread. But being forced to serve oversized bundles feels a bit like being given too much food at the restaurant, so I can understand why developers would welcome any tool that lets them make their apps less wasteful. 

Hot module reloading also got a comparatively high score despite not having any impact on the user experience, which again shows just how much of a game changer it is when it comes to speeding up your workflow. 

Finally, optimistic updates and time-travel debugging both suffer from being somewhat complex, misunderstood features with low awareness. It'll be interesting to keep an eye on them and see how their rating evolves in future editions of this survey.

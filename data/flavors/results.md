### How To Read This Chart

The **All** view presents all five options on the same chart, while the **Interest** and **Satisfaction** lets you isolate the “interested/not interested” and “would use again/wouldn't use again” pairs.  

Note that when selecting the **Interest** or **Satisfaction** view, percentages are relative to the current pair (in other words, the two highlighted bars combined total 100%).

### Awareness

ES6, [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/), and [TypeScript](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript) all have near-perfect awareness, which surprised me since TypeScript isn’t quite as popular as the other two yet.

[Elm](http://elm-lang.org/) and [ClojureScript](https://clojurescript.org/) on the other hand have much lower scores, which makes sense since they’re more tied to their own ecosystems, and harder to use in existing apps.

### Interest

It’s interesting to look at ES6: a large proportion of developers have already jumped on the bandwagon, and almost all (89%) of those who haven’t yet want to learn it as well.

TypeScript and Elm are in the same boat: not many people have used them, but they have 53% and 58% interest scores respectively, which isn’t bad by any means.
If I had to guess, I’d say that both TypeScript and Elm might be having a hard time articulating their advantages to the average JavaScript developer. After all it’s hard to understand the advantages of something like static typing if all you know is JavaScript.

Also, few developers have used CoffeeScript, and apparently almost nobody wants to learn it. There goes my plan to write a 12-volume CoffeeScript Encyclopedia…

### Satisfaction

We now come to the key question: how many developers have used each specific flavor, and how many would use it again?

While plain JavaScript has the largest usage numbers, in terms of satisfaction the big winner here is ES6, and I think it’s safe to say it’s now the default way to write JavaScript apps.

TypeScript and Elm both also have similarly high satisfaction percentages, around 85%. And once more, poor CoffeeScript trails the poll with only 17% of developers willing to consider it again.

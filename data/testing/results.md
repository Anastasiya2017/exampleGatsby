Overall, [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) and [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) stand tall, each having roughly 90% awareness
and high degrees of interest and satisfaction. In contrast, the rest of the
field remains relatively unknown.

The data shows something fascinating about the relationship between satisfaction
and interest: the more people are satisfied with a framework, the more other
people are more likely to be interested in learning it.

Mocha, Jasmine, and [Enzyme](http://airbnb.io/enzyme/) lead the pack with high scores in both satisfaction
and interest. [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) and [Cucumber](https://cucumber.io/docs/reference/javascript) bring up the rear with relatively low
scores in both categories.

This makes intuitive sense, but it's actually a bit surprising. It seems to
indicate that marketing is a non-factor in the Javascript testing world, and
that each framework is succeeding on its own merit. That might be a first!

At 24% awareness, newcomer [Ava](https://github.com/avajs/ava) lacks community mindshare. But with reasonably
high interest and satisfaction scores, we can expect that to change in the
future.

For fun, I wrote a Gherkin spec for Cucumber's satisfaction rating:

<pre>
Given you are testing JS,
When you try Cucumber,
Then you'd rather not use it again.
</pre>

OK that's a little unfair. After all, it's no [Coffeescript](/2016/flavors/). But
it does stick out like a sore thumb in the testing category.

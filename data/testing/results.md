Like the rest of Javascript world, the testing landscape is highly competitive
one, with rapid release cycles, feature and performance comparisons, and
constant one-upsmanship between the frameworks.

### Awareness

**Mocha** and **Jasmine** stand tall, each having roughly 90% awareness. In contrast, the
rest of the field remain relatively unknown.

At 24% awareness, newcomer **Ava** is relatively unknown. But with reasonably
high interest and satisfaction scores, we can expect that to change in the
future.

### Interest and Satisfaction

When it comes to interest and satisfaction, the data reveals something
fascinating: the more people are satisfied with a framework, the more other
people are more likely to be interested in learning it.

Mocha, Jasmine, and **Enzyme** lead the pack with high scores in both satisfaction
and interest. **Jest** and **Cucumber** bring up the rear with relatively low
scores in both categories.

This makes intuitive sense, but it's actually a bit surprising. It seems to
indicate that marketing is a non-factor in the Javascript testing world, and
that each framework is succeeding on its own merit. That might be a first!

For fun, wrote a Gherkin spec for Cucumber's satisfaction rating:

```
Given you are testing JS,
When you try Cucumber,
Then you never want to use it again.
```

Yes that's a little unfair. After all, it's no [Coffeescript](/2016/flavors/). But
it does stick out like a sore thumb in the testing category.

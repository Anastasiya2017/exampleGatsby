Of the remaining write-in frameworks, Javascript users love them some [**Tape**](https://github.com/substack/tape).
Javascript author Eric Elliott makes a case for it in his essay [Why I use Tape Instead of Mocha & So Should You](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/why-i-use-tape-instead-of-mocha-so-should-you-6aa105d8eaf4).

Other popular write-ins include jQuery's testing framework [qUnit](https://qunitjs.com/), the test runner
[Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io/1.0/index.html), and Angular's [protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

Given the lack of satisfaction among Javascript testers, I would not be surprised to see a different set of
options a year from now.

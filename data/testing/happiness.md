Javascript testers are not a happy bunch. In addition to receiving one of the lower
happiness scores of different aspects of the Javascript ecosystem, the write-in responses
were a minefield of expletives.

Some choice samples:
- Those are all super @#$^%!
- Most 'things' are honestly just way too #&!%ing @#$^% to take seriously. Really!
- Testing is %&!!@#$^

Tell us what you really think people! Additionally, many people wrote in that
they don't do any automated testing. Based on this feedback, it's unclear
whether the dissatisfaction is due to the existing set of tools, or whether
people are just unhappy with testing in general.

But as the Javascript testing world churns on like the rest of the JS ecosystem,
hopefully we can see solutions on the way.

The single strongest correlation in the testing category, is **Mocha** and **Jasmine**.
Not only are people generally happy with both frameworks, but people who are happy
with one tend to be happy with the other!

Mocha has an edge over Jasmine when it comes to newer technologies: it tends to
be co-used with **ES6**, **React**, **Redux**, and **Webpack**. We can also see
a tech hipster factor in the data as well: **Enzyme** and **Ava** appear to
cluster a little bit with **CSS Modules** and **Aphrodite**.

[NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) is of course, listed with the highest usage in this category, being (literally) the Node Package Manager and supporting build scripts as well.

Not too far behind is Rollup, (less than two years old) which claims to produce smaller bundles than Browserify or Webpack. Its sudden popularity may be due to the insane amount of documentation - there’s a guide, a wiki, and a live demo - and a feature they’re calling [tree-shaking](https://medium.com/@Rich_Harris/tree-shaking-versus-dead-code-elimination-d3765df85c80#.vzdwa0234).

I’m surprised to see Make still in the running. A glimmer of hope that some people still believe that if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it. Also, I’m just going to put it out there and say, [Rollup](http://rollupjs.org/), [Broccoli](https://github.com/broccolijs/broccoli), [Brunch](http://brunch.io/): we really like naming software after food, don’t we?

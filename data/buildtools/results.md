### Awareness

Unlike the other sections of the survey which have at least one or two options people haven’t heard of, practically every developer surveyed was at least aware of the existence of the four survey options, which all clocked in at 91% awareness or higher.

### Interest

We JavaScript developers enjoy the new and shiny, and it shows in this graph. Not surprisingly, two-year-old [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) has the highest interest - almost 1.5 times or more higher than [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/), [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/), and [Browserify](http://browserify.org/), probably also due to its flexibility and ability to handle many file types.

Grunt’s interest has waned heavily, with two thirds of respondents uninterested in trying it. Those that have heard of Gulp and Browserify are almost equally interested and uninterested.

### Satisfaction

With the vast majority of Webpack users satisfied with the new bundler, it’s no wonder that interest in the tool is so high. Although, even with the new kid on the block, Browserify and Gulp users are still fairly happy as well. 

In contrast, Grunt users appear the least satisfied and don’t want to go back, which matches the low interest levels seen previously.

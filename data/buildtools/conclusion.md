It doesnâ€™t seem too long ago that people were wondering about the battle between Grunt and Gulp. Based on the results of this survey, it sound like Grunt may be in for quite a fight if it wants to survive.

Webpack may be the new hotness, but with many people still interested in and using Browserify, bundlers are in a less competitive arena. With competitors like Rollup on the horizon though, it should be an interesting future. Watch this space!

Special thanks to Timothy Licata for listening to my late night rants and German (Gago) Frigerio for walking me through a bit of build tool history.

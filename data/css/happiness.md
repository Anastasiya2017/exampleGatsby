Overall, CSS is in a pretty good place with a **3.75** average happiness score. 

There a lot of options for CSS and developers use many of them, but the data shows that if you're looking for a framework, you can't go wrong with SASS.

If on the other hand you want to write encapsulated, portable code, and especially if you already use React, you'll should check out either CSS Modules or a “CSS in JS” framework like Aphrodite.

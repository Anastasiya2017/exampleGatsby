Although CSS is hardly related to JavaScript, it's becoming more tightly coupled to it thanks to the popularity of client-side JavaScript frameworks.

And just like JavaScript, CSS is a mess. There are many variants of CSS frameworks or preprocessors which extend capabilities of standard CSS (or Plain CSS). [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/), [LESS](http://lesscss.org/), and [CSS Modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules) are just a few examples of such tools.

Looking at the result of the survey, it seems both SASS and Plain CSS are used by developers at the same level. But looking at the satisfaction rate, it turns out that developers who use SASS and CSS Modules are more satisfied with them compared to the other options.
